# Frontend
I'm going to build our website based on this [ECommerce template](https://github.com/jamstack-cms/jamstack-ecommerce). The first step I did is switching Yarn to NPM and updating Next.js to v12 which has lots of awesome features.
Since the backend has not finished yet, I'm going to use a [GraphCMS](https://app.hygraph.com/fc4d0460e3ae4e14b22231657b87167d/master) as our content manager system provding data thorough a GraphQL api.
